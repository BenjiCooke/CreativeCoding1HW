GUI, or Graphical User Interface, is what most people understand when it comes to user interfaces on computers.
It is a form of file and app navigation that utilizes graphics (images, buttons, and automatic commands) rather than text.
CLI, or Command Line Interface, like GUI, is a way to navigate files and apps on a computer. CLI doesn't use graphics, but rather,
is entirely controlled by text commands.
To the common eye, CLI can be more difficult to navigate than GUI, however it offers many advantages in terms of accessibility and control over a system.
Using specific commands in CLI, a user can access information and complete complex tasks more efficiently than they could with GUI.
Because GUI focuses heavily on graphics, it takes a larger toll on performance, but with graphics, almost anyone can use a computer with little training.
CLI requires users to either memorize or look up commands, which is usually only beneficial if the user's line of work falls under Computer Science or Cyber Security.
Overall, both GUI and CLI are helpful in their own ways. GUI is a way of navigating a computer easily for general tasks, while CLI is for navigating and controlling a computer specifically and efficiently.
